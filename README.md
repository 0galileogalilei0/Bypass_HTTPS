# Bypassing HTTPS: Advanced Techniques

## Overview
This repository contains advanced scripts and methodologies used for penetration testing and security research to analyze and manipulate HTTPS traffic. The techniques covered include:

- **TLS Stripping**: Downgrade HTTPS to HTTP to intercept plaintext traffic.
- **SSL Pinning Bypass**: Intercept mobile app traffic using Frida.
- **MITM Proxy Interception**: Modify HTTPS requests and responses dynamically.
- **Weak Cipher Exploitation**: Detect and exploit outdated SSL/TLS configurations.

**⚠️ WARNING: This repository is intended for ethical hacking and security research purposes only. Unauthorized usage is illegal and punishable by law.**

## Features
- **TLS Strip Attack**: ARP spoofing + SSLStrip for HTTPS downgrade.
- **Android SSL Pinning Bypass**: Frida script to disable SSL verification.
- **MITM Interception**: Capture and modify HTTPS traffic in real-time.
- **SSL Vulnerability Scanner**: Identify weak ciphers and misconfigurations.

## Installation
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip mitmproxy
pip install scapy frida
```

## Usage

### 1️⃣ TLS Stripping Attack
```bash
sudo python3 Bypass_HTPPS.py
```
- Redirects victim's traffic through the attacker's machine.
- Downgrades HTTPS requests to HTTP for credential interception.

### 2️⃣ Bypassing SSL Pinning (Android Apps)
```bash
frida -U -n target.app -s ssl_pinning_bypass.js --no-pause
```
- Hooks into the app’s SSL validation to accept all certificates.
- Allows interception via Burp Suite.

### 3️⃣ MITM Proxy for HTTPS Traffic Manipulation
```bash
mitmproxy -s mitm_interceptor.py
```
- Logs intercepted HTTPS credentials and cookies.
- Modifies HTTP responses dynamically.

### 4️⃣ Checking for Weak SSL Ciphers
```bash
python3 ssl_vuln_scanner.py example.com
```
- Identifies servers vulnerable to weak TLS encryption.
